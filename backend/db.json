      "author": " Dmitry Mayorov",
      "content": "This seemingly simple task had me scratching my head for a few hours while I was working on my website. As it turns out, getting the current page URL in Gatsby is not as straightforward as you may think, but also not so complicated to understand.\n\nLet‚Äôs look at a few methods of making it happen. But first, you might be wondering why on earth we‚Äôd even want to do something like this.\n\n\n#Why you might need the current URL\nSo before we get into the how, let‚Äôs first answer the bigger question: Why would you want to get the URL of the current page? I can offer a few use cases.\n\nMeta tags\nThe first obvious thing that you‚Äôd want the current URL for is meta tags in the document head:\n\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href={url} />\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content={url} />\nSocial Sharing\nI‚Äôve seen it on multiple websites where a link to the current page is displayed next to sharing buttons. Something like this (found on Creative Market)"

      "author": "Chris Coyier ",
      "content": "GraphQL has all kinds of awesome tooling built around it. But like everything on the web, it ultimately comes down to data shootin' across the ol' network and responses coming back. If you need to talk to a GraphQL API endpoint, you don't absolutely have to use some kind of framework or library to make requests against it. As a matter of fact, you can do it pretty cleanly in vanilla JavaScript.‚Ä¶ Read article"

      "author": "Sarah Drasner",
      "content": "The team at HeroDevs has just released the alpha version of Scully, a static site generator for Angular. That's right, Angular didn't have an intuitive way to create JAMstack applications before, but now it's possible!\n\nScully uses a node CLI application to run Angular schematics so you don‚Äôt have to learn any new language or syntax. You can see your static files in a new dist folder called static alongside your application folder.\n\nTo watch the full setup, Tara ‚Ä¶"

      "content": "I always love seeing people get inspired by print design and trying to port it over to the web. There is a much deeper history of interesting print work to draw from, and still a ton of modern work happening that eclipses most digital design work today. The web is fully capable of bold, interesting designs, yet we see it all-too-rarely.\n\nJust lately, we've seen a little surge of interest...‚Ä¶ Read article"

By fancy, I mean two things:\n\nThe articles had a specially-designed template just for them.

      "author": "Fake Author",
      "content": "t's no big secret that Netlify invented the term JAMstack. While it's possible to embrace the JAMstack without using Netlify, it's notable that Netlify is at the very heart of the whole \"JAMstack landscape.\"\n\nWhat does \"JAMstack landscape\" even mean? I like the term because it sets the stage that JAMstack isn't just this one thing, but a way of building sites by piecing together a bunch of different ideas, the most important of which is static file hosting.
